# CS211
From Syllabus:

CS 211 builds on the computational problem solving, and Python programming skills developed in CS 210
and introduces object-oriented programming techniques.
After successfully completing CS 211, you should be able to:
  - Use classes and objects in an object-oriented programming language, including polymorphism and
inheritance.
  - Develop an operational understanding (e.g., what happens when we construct an object) and idiomatic
problem-solving tactics in object-oriented programming. You will read and write program source code
in an object-oriented style, including:
    - Using polymorphism and dynamic dispatch to simplify program logic.
    - Using dynamic dispatch to create listener/notifier connections between program modules.
    - Using abstract classes and methods to organize related concrete subclasses and methods, with
inheritance and overriding.
    - Constructing recursive object-oriented data structures, with recursive algorithms factored into
base and inductive cases by subclass.
  - Decompose a moderately complex problem specification into parts that can be solved piece by piece,
testing your solution at each stage in development.
  - Write software source code that communicates intent to human readers and correctly expresses intended
instructions for the computer.
  - Reason about asymptotic performance characteristics (the relation of time and space requirements to
problem size) well enough to devise programs with acceptable performance on moderate to large problems.
